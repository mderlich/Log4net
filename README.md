----------------------------------------------

The logger will use log4net's default log levels system. 
The system consists of the 5 levels:

Fatal 	— used for reporting about errors that are forcing shutdown of the application.
Error 	— used for logging serious problems occurred during execution of the program.
Warn  	— used for reporting non-critical unusual behavior.
Info 	— used for informative messages highlighting the progress of the application for sysadmin and end user.
Debug 	— used for debugging messages with extended information about application processing.
